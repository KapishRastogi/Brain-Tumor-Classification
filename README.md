# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This Brain tumor classification is performed on MRI-scanned images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models.
# **Dataset**
I have taken the dataset from Kaggle, and it comprises a total of 42,500 MRI scan images featuring various types of brain tumors, including gliomas and meningiomas, as well as images without tumors.
