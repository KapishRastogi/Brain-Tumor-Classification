# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This Brain tumor classification is performed on MRI-scanned images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models.
# **Dataset**
I have taken the dataset from Kaggle, and it comprises a total of 42,500 MRI scan images featuring various types of brain tumors, including gliomas and meningiomas, as well as images without tumors.
# Platform
The models are running on Google Colab since it provides better GPU and RAM than my system.
For running the model upload the dataset in google drive and use it.
